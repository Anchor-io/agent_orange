agent_orange - User Agent detection for Ruby

There are quite a few User Agent parsing libraries already, but none of them make adequate
detection of mobile browsers and clients. With such a significant number of requests
coming from mobile users a library with the ability to detect what type of device a user
is coming from is necessary.

This library for Ruby will allow you to detect whether a user is on a computer, a mobile
device, or is a bot (such as Google). It was composed by using techniques gathered from
several other libraries/gems in an effort to be consistent and cover as many types
of agents as possible.

STATUS: Design stage. This library is not yet usable. Please contact me if you'd like
to participate.
