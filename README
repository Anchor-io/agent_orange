agent_orange - User Agent detection for Ruby

There are quite a few User Agent parsing libraries already, but none of them make adequate
detection of mobile browsers and clients. With such a significant number of requests
coming from mobile users a library with the ability to detect what type of device a user
is coming from is necessary.

This library for Ruby will allow you to detect whether a user is on a computer, a mobile
device, or is a bot (such as Google). It was composed by using techniques gathered from
several other libraries/gems in an effort to be consistent and cover as many types
of agents as possible.

STATUS: Design stage. This library is not yet usable. Please contact me if you'd like
to participate.


# Create new parser and return device

>> p = AgentOrange::Parser.new("test")

# Looking at the device

>> device = p.device
=> "iPhone 3G"
>> device.type
=> "mobile"
>> device.manufacturer
=> "Apple"
>> device.name
=> "iPhone"
>> device.version
=> "3G"
>> p.is_mobile?
=> true
>> device.is_mobile?
=> true

# Looking at the web engine

>> engine = p.device.engine
=> "WebKit 5.3"
>> engine.type
=> "webkit"
>> engine.name
=> "WebKit"
>> engine.version
=> "5.3.1.2321"
>> engine.version.lite
=> "5.3"

# Looking at the browser

>> browser = p.device.engine.browser
=> "Internet Explorer 10"
>> browser.type
=> "ie"
>> browser.name
=> "Internet Explorer"
>> browser.version
=> "10.0.112"
>> browser.version.minor
=> "10.0"
>> browser.version.major
=> "10"

# Browser Version
>> AgentOrange::Parser.new("test").device.engine.browser.version
=> "10.0.112"
